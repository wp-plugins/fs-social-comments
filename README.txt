Allow you to integrate facebook comment on your site and sync it on wordpress comments page.

== Description ==

Welcome, this plugin will help you to synchronize facebook comments with wordpress integrated comments . 
We are currently in beta, so functions like delete and spam at the moment are not available. 
WARNING: Erasing or moderate comments by the wordpress comments page will have no effect on the comments of facebook so take care.

A few notes about the sections above:

*   "Contributors" fabio.sirchia
*   "Tags" facebook,social comments,comments facebook wordpress,comment,wordpress comment,social comment
*   "Requires at least" 4.0.1
*   "Tested up to" 4.2.2
*   Stable tag should indicate the Subversion "tag" of the latest stable version, or "trunk," if you use `/trunk/` for
stable.

    Note that the `readme.txt` of the stable tag is the one that is considered the defining one for the plugin, so
if the `/trunk/readme.txt` file says that the stable tag is `4.3`, then it is `/tags/4.3/readme.txt` that'll be used
for displaying information about the plugin.  In this situation, the only thing considered from the trunk `readme.txt`
is the stable tag pointer.  Thus, if you develop in trunk, you can update the trunk `readme.txt` to reflect changes in
your in-development version, without having that information incorrectly disclosed about the current stable version
that lacks those changes -- as long as the trunk's `readme.txt` points to the correct stable tag.

    If no stable tag is provided, it is assumed that trunk is stable, but you should specify "trunk" if that's where
you put the stable version, in order to eliminate any doubt.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `fs-social-comments` dir to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Check if under comments menu there is the settings page.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
